                "I worked in the warehouse industry for 5 years and when I was promoted to be an inventory specialist, I was tasked with improving the inventory management system. It was a challenge that I had to iterate on a few times, but the feeling when I started seeing results lit a fire in my eyes.",
                "Thats when I discovered my passion for software development and system design! I self taught myself the basics of frontend and backend system development. I started building small projects, joining hackathons, working on personal projects all which led me to getting my first contract job as a freelance developer. Currently, I'm upping my game by attending the Hack Reactor bootcamp to polish my full stack developer skills.",
